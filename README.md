An inception network is a deep neural network with an architectural design that consists of repeating components referred to as Inception modules. As mentioned earlier, this article focuses on the technical details of the inception module.Inception Modules are used in Convolutional Neural Networks to allow for more efficient computation and deeper Networks through a dimensionality reduction with stacked 1×1 convolutions. The modules were designed to solve the problem of computational expense, as well as overfitting, among other issues.“(Inception Layer) is a combination of all those layers (namely, 1×1 Convolutional layer, 3×3 Convolutional layer, 5×5 Convolutional layer) with their output filter banks concatenated into a single output vector forming the input of the next stage.”MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network architecture that seeks to perform well on mobile devices. It is based on an inverted residual structure where the residual connections are between the bottleneck layers.Inception Modules are used in Convolutional Neural Networks to allow for more efficient computation and deeper Networks through a dimensionality reduction with stacked 1×1 convolutions.

The Inception V3 is a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks, which is used for image classification. The inception V3 is a superior version of the basic model Inception V1 which was introduced as GoogLeNet in 2014.There are four layers, the last of which is called "limbo". Cobb and Ariadne enter the limbo layer using their technology (not by killing themselves) to get Fischer Jr. and Saitor out of it.GoogLeNet is a convolutional neural network that is 22 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on either the ImageNet [1] or Places365 [2] [3] data sets. The network trained on ImageNet classifies images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.The main idea of the Inception module is that of running multiple operations (pooling, convolution) with multiple filter sizes (3x3, 5x5…) in parallel so that we do not have to face any trade-offDeep learning is rapidly gaining steam as more and more research papers emerge from around the world. These papers undoubtedly contain a ton of information, but they can often be difficult to parse through. And to understand them, you might have to go through that paper multiple number of times (and perhaps even other dependent papers!).

This is truly a daunting task for non-academicians like us.Personally, I find the task of going through a research paper, interpreting the crux behind it, and implementing the code as an important skill every deep learning enthusiast and practitioner should possess. Practically implementing research ideas brings out the thought process of the author and also helps transform those ideas into real-world industry applications.

So in this article (and the subsequent series of articles) my motive of writing is two-fold:

Enable the readers to keep abreast with cutting edge research by breaking down deep learning papers into understandable concepts
Learn to convert research ideas to code myself, and encourage people to do so simultaneously
This article assumes that you have a good grasp on the basics of deep learning. In case you don’t, or simply need a refresher, check out the below articles first and then head back here pronto:This article focuses on the paper “Going deeper with convolutions” from which the hallmark idea of inception network came out. Inception network was once considered a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture (or model) for solving image recognition and detection problems.

It put forward a breakthrough performance on the ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge (in 2014), which is a reputed platform for benchmarking image recognition and detection algorithms. Along with this, it set off a ton of research in the creation of new deep learning architectures with innovative and impactful ideas.

We will go through the main ideas and suggestions propounded in the aforementioned paper and try to grasp the techniques within. In the words of the author:

“In this paper, we will focus on an efficient deep neural network architecture for computer vision, code named Inception, which derives its name from (…) the famous “we need to go deeper” internet meme.”There’s a simple but powerful way of creating better deep learning models. You can just make a bigger model, either in terms of deepness, i.e., number of layers, or the number of neurons in each layer. But as you can imagine, this can often create complications:

Bigger the model, more prone it is to overfitting. This is particularly noticeable when the training data is small
Increasing the number of parameters means you need to increase your existing computational resources
A solution for this, as the paper suggests, is to move on to sparsely connected network architectures which will replace fully connected network architectures, especially inside convolutional layers. This idea can be conceptualized in the below images:Sparsely connected architecture

This paper proposes a new idea of creating deep architectures.
